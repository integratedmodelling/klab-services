# k.LAB Modeler

The modeler is a controller for a set of views and panels that together provide a IDE for k.LAB. This package provides
only the controller components: the view must be provided by other implementations. As such, this package can be used to
create a k.LAB modeler running as an independent application (like the Eclipse default implementation in the
klab-modeler project) or as a web application.
