/**
 * A grid is the specification of the grid geometry adopted by a rectangular-tiled {@link Tile} extent. It can be
 * complete, including envelope, or partial, only including the step size and possibly anchor points. It must always
 * include a projection. The Grid can be passed to a Tile constructor to ensure alignment of grids. Every Tile extent
 * that is made of rectangular tiles must be able to produce the Grid that defines it.
 * <p>
 * Grids can be defined as scoped k.IM class <code>define</code> objects so that they can be stored and used to define
 * consistent gridded spatial contexts. A {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.geometry.Geometry} can also be the
 * source of a Grid specification, for example in a
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.services.runtime.extension.KlabFunction} annotation.
