/**
 * Values can be a lot of different things in k.Actors and serve as matches for fired values, so we
 * categorize them on parsing to allow quick matching. The categorization includes the distinction
 * between syntactic roles and is not just about type (e.g. a naked identifier is not a string). A
 * derived class should use this as delegate to define as() to match types to useful objects not
 * part of the interface.
 * <p>
 * Values can also be used to encode expressions, potentially building an evaluation tree, although
 * parenthesized expressions are for now made impossible by the syntax (round brackets used for too
 * many other purposes) and the only expression supported is a ternary operator. Operators can be
 * easily added but I'm not sure it would be a good idea without the possibility to parenthesize
 * (and the likely fact that an apparently legitimate parenthesized expression would parse correctly
 * and mean something else entirely).
 * <p>
 * An error value (whose content may be null, an exception or a string message) will not match
 * anything except ANYTHING or ERROR.
