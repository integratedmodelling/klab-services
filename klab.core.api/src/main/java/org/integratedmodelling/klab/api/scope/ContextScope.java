/**
 * The scope for an observation context and any observations made within it. The observation scope
 * is the handle to the "digital twin" of the observations made in it and contains all the methods
 * that give access to the observation, dataflow and provenance graphs. These are available from the
 * GraphQL API served by the {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.services.RuntimeService}.
 *
 * <p>The context scope always has an observer that can be switched to another when making
 * observations. The observer is an observation of an agent that also specifies an observed geometry
 * in addition to its own. The calling client should explicitly provide an observer; if not, the
 * digital twin should provide one by default, using information from the parent scopes (session
 * user identity, including any roles specified in the user groups subscribed to). Observations of
 * the same observable with different observers are different observations.
 *
 * <p>A context scope is used to add observations, which will trigger resolution, through {@link
 * #observe(Observation)} and carries information (parent observation, observer, namespace, project,
 * scenarios) that is relevant to the resolver. Scopes can be specialized to customize resolution
 * before {@link #observe(Observation)} is called, and their status is passed across network
 * boundaries, encoded in the scope header added to requests that trigger resolution. If resolution
 * in the runtime fails, the resulting observation will be in an unresolved state, unusable to make
 * any further resolution, and the context is inconsistent unless all the inconsistent observations
 * are substantials that can simply be stated. In the runtime service API, the GraphQL endpoint is
 * used to submit observations to a digital twin for resolution through a mutation.
 *
 * <p>The context scope carries the URL of the digital twin (a GraphQL endpoint) and can be
 * connected to another to form larger, multi-observer, distributed scopes.
