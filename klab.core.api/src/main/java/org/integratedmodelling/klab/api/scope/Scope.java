/**
 * The scope is a communication channel that holds all information about the knowledge environment in the
 * service. That includes other services, which must be set into the scope in either an embedded or client
 * implementation and are made available through {@link #getService(Class)}. A scope of the appropriate class
 * are a required argument to most calls in the k.LAB API.
 * <p>
 * There are three major classes of scope: authentication produces a {@link UserScope}, which can spawn
 * sessions and applications as "child" {@link SessionScope}s. Within these, {@link ContextScope}s are used to
 * create and maintain the environments where observations are made, serving as a handle to a "digital twin"
 * that manages a dynamic, semantic knowledge graph (the "context"). In addition, a {@link ServiceScope} is
 * used by each service to access logging, the owning identity, and other services.
 * <p>
 * The scope can be seen as an underlying software agent, incarnating the identity that owns the scope in a
 * reactive environment. According to implementation, a reactive agent may or may not be physically
 * implemented (in the reference implementation, agents are created on demand and they run k.Actors
 * behaviors).
 * <p>
 * In a service context, the authentication mechanism is responsible for maintaining a valid hierarchy of
 * scopes based on the authorization token, which must generate a valid {@link UserScope}. Scopes are not
 * serialized for communication between services, but are replicated explicitly by the originating service
 * into any other service that must be aware of them, using the
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.ServicesAPI#CREATE_SESSION} and
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.ServicesAPI#CREATE_CONTEXT} calls, after which they are referred to
 * through the {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.ServicesAPI#SCOPE_HEADER} in REST calls that require
 * scopes below the user level. Each service maintains the state it needs to operate. The originator of
 * {@link SessionScope}s and {@link ContextScope} is always the
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.services.RuntimeService}.
 * <p>
 * A "remote" scope implements {@link #send(Object...)} and the logging methods inherited from {@link Channel}
 * so that they can communicate across services to their peer scopes using a suitable RPC mechanism (the
 * reference implementation uses AMPQ messaging and separate queues for different event streams). The RPC
 * mechanism is crucial to connect observation scopes into distributed digital twins.
 * <p>
 * Scopes expire according to their expiration type returned by {@link #getPersistence()}. Services are
 * configured to define the details and may refuse scope creation requests that require unsupported expiration
 * types.
