/**
 * Units of measurement. Creation and inquiry methods are provided by
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.services.UnitService}.
 * <p>
 * Much more complex than (not-really-)standard JRS-375 units due to the need of scale awareness and
 * semantic-driven value aggregation and propagation. When a quality is extensive, its value can be translated to
 * units that are incompatible because they either add or remove one or more contextual dimensions
 * (space and/or time). Also, the unit may already contain an implicit contextualization and be
 * valid for the semantics of the observable once the contextualization is factored in: for example,
 * volume of rain can be measured in mm as long as the context is 2D space, in which case mm means
 * the density of the volume (mm^3/mm^2) and is valid for the semantics of a volume.
 * <p>
 * k.LAB validates unit appropriateness <em>in context</em> and requires declaration of any
 * discrepancy between intensive/extensive character using annotations. If those are provided
 * correctly, context translations are possible even within the same model: for example, a weather
 * process model may produce extensive rainfall in both space and time (e.g. in m^2, applied to each
 * timestep and area subdivision) and area/time intensive snow (e.g. in mm/day) at the same time.
 * <p>
 * The unit API enables contextual conversion by using a specialized {@link Unit} implementation.
 * When the context is factored in, the scale of computation for the unit is incorporated in the
 * declared unit by obtaining a contextualized unit from
