     * <p>
     * The resulting mediator will only accept the {@link #convert(Number, Locator)} call and throw
     * an exception in any other situation. If the observable passed has no mediator, the conversion
     * will be standard and non-contextual (using a simple conversion factor for speed). Otherwise,
     * the fastest set of transformations will be encoded in the returned mediator.
     * <p>
     * The resulting mediator will perform correcly <em>only</em> when used with locators coming
     * from the same scale that was used to produce it. It will contain transformations in
     * parametric form, so that the possible irregularity of the extents in the locators is
     * accounted for.
     * <p>
     * The strategy to create the necessary transformations, consisting in parametric
     * multiplications or divisions by an appropriately transformed extent in space and/or time, is
     * as follows:
     * <ol>
     * <li>if observable is intensive, just check compatibility and return self if compatible, throw
     * exception if not. Otherwise:
     * <li>obtain contextualized candidate forms of both the observable's base unit and self. Both
     * should have one compatible form in the candidates. If not, throw exception. If the compatible
     * form is the same, proceed as in (1). Otherwise:
     * <li>devise two strategies to mediate 1) incoming form to base form and 2) base form to this.
     * Each strategy consists of a list of parametric operations on S/T contexts with a conversion
     * factor for the basic representation (m^x for space, ms for time).
     * <li>simplify the two strategies into a single set of operations to add to the contextualized
     * unit returned, which also carries the definition of the contextual nature re: S/T and a
     * string explaining the transformations made and why.
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * EXAMPLE
     * <p>
     * Precipitation comes from data as mm/day. The I,I form of the observable base unit (m^3) in
     * T,S is m/s, compatible. OK - proceed. Target is m, which is I,E w.r.t. the target as seen
     * matching to the contextualized extension of m^3. Specific extents must match - if AREAL and
     * LINEAL are seen together, no compatibility can exist.
     * <p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>Turn mm/day -> m/s. Only a multiplicative factor M1 is needed.</li>
     * <li>Turn m/s (I,I) into its (I,E) form using T extension -> mm: op(x * Tms * 1000)</li>
     * <li>Turn the resulting mm into m. Another multiplication factor (M2)</li>
     * <li>Final strategy is (M1*M2*1000)*x*Tms.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * In case the target is m^3: I,I -> E,E so step 2 produces two extensions:
     * op(x*Tms*1000)op(x*S)
     * <p>
     * Model validator should always WARN if extensive is output by data AS LONG AS data come with
     * their fully specified extension (e.g. T is physical). Otherwise it's an error.
