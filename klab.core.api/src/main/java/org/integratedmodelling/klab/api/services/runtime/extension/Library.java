/**
 * Tags a class that contains extensions for one of the k.LAB components. Extensions can be
 * contextualizers, actor functions or other elements; the tag they are annotated with determines
 * the use that can be made of them and their registration in a service. Libraries have a name that
 * is prepended to the name of any object it declares; only the core k.LAB implementation is allowed
 * to use the CORE_LIBRARY identifier, which makes them available with a single identifier.
 *
 * <p>Some libraries can be imported with an "import" instruction from a language. Others are
 * pre-loaded in test cases and scripts. Libraries are used to provide k.Actors actions and k.IM
 * contextualizers through static inner classes or methods, which should bear the annotation {@link
 * Verb} or {@link KlabFunction}.
 *
 * <p>Contextualizers implementations from the core libraries can be overridden from configuration
 * using classes from loaded plug-ins, so that the runtime can be customized to specific needs in
 * terms of accuracy or logics.
