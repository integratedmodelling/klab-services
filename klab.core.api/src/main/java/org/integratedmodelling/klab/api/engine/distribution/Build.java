/**
 * A specific build of a {@link Product}. This is the object we use to run a product, which contains zero or
 * more releases, each containing one or more builds. The version of a build must be the same as that of the
 * containing release, plus a build number that must be sortable as a string so that the builds can be
 * presented in reverse chronological order.
 * <p>
 * In a published distribution (such as those made by the <code>klab.product</code> Maven plugin) the build
 * contains a build.properties file which points to the subdirectories containing each version, which in
 * turns contains a release.properties file with the rest of the information. The release name is usually a
 * branch name and has no version. Yet, to keep the hierarchy simpler we build a Release object per each
 * version and add them directly to the product in the API.
